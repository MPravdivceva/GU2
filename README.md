# GU2
Last academic year I had a task to create a commercial website as a graded unit project. I have created a website for a hypothetical business which sells presents online. I have delivered this project fully by myself, starting from the client's brief (role played by the lecturer), estimating functional and non-functional requirements and implementing it using agile methodology till full deployment and testing. I used CSS, bootstrap, JavaScript, and HTML for frontend development and SQL for writing databases which was implemented using Oracle APEX. I have created and used a testing plan for functional requirements and worked on debugging. Unfortunately, I can't share my Graded unit documentation publicly but I have put the code files and a video recording.
